#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The easiest way to ensure code is functional is by running it. if the program runs, you are in the right direction. The next necessity is ensuring that your program is safe for the users and to project it self. To do this you must run several manually and automated tests whether it is with unit tests, or sent to professional testers.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Once you are sent requirements by the user, you must run through the document and break down each main point. Once you identify the main goal of the program, it is time for you as the programmer to understand what needs to be done that the user doesn't know. Knowing how the program needs to be protected, what needs to be incorporated, and what functionality is needed is all up to you, but you have the knowledge due to your initial assesment and process for breaking down the initial requirements.

#How do I approach designing software?

I personally begin by reading over the requirements. The first thing I need to know is what needs to be included and why. Seeing as I have only developed code for school I don't have the need to question it, but I am trying to train my self for when I do it professionally. Once I have the main goal, and the parts that are not included in requirements but that need to be in there, I like to get my thoughts down. I prefer to write initial code, and then develop from there. This may backwards but it is easier for me to work on a project once I see I have a little progress made, rather than looking at a blank page/screen.
